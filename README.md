# What is mtg-term?
It is a minimalistic, open-source, mtg-like game, made in python, that can be played on most terminal emulator on linux.
The first goal to be realistic in scope, is to have a playable single player game, with simple generated card, that have simple [__Keyword ability__](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Keyword_ability) effect. Then once completed, add complexity progressivelly, and maybe in the far long distant future a form of multiplayer.
