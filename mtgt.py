## Cards class
### Creature, Land and other card type card class
### (Color cost could be stored in an array with five index of integer representing the color cost, and an extra index for the color less cost.)

class Card:
	def __init__(self, self_id, attack, deffence, color, cost, card_type):
		self.self_id = self_id;
		self.attack = attack;
		self.deffence = deffence;
		self.color = color;
		self.type=card_type; # Sorcery, Land, Enchantment, Creature...
		self.kind=kind; # Human, Dinosaur Avatar, Vampire...
		self.cost = cost;

# Cursor selection	
class selection: 
	def __init__(self, x, y, over, selected):		
# Player 
## (Don't forget to add an extra deck)	
## (You can use 2D array to stack card in the same place.)
### (Might be a better idea to separate the field variable from the player class init function.)
class Player:
	def __init__(self, self_id, deck, hand, health, mana_zone, field_zone, graveyard):

		self.graveyard = graveyard
		
	def select_card(source, player):
		# Here a card can be selected from source array by player
		## This process should be automated when playing against the machine.
		### Exception may need to be applied in a way or another, like the card type or color, or cost, or inded (position) in the source array.
		return selection
	
	def move_card(source, selected, destination):
		# Card zone change	
		## (Basically a function to move a card from any zone, to any zone if, an effect or situation require it.)
		### zone = graveuard, hand. field, deck...
		#### Remove selected card from source (zone) array and add it to destination (zone) array.
