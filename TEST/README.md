# It's ugly, but it's working!
By working i mean it does things...
It's far from a final project, i am a shame of this code...
It's Ugly and really overcomplicated, not clear, and not flexible...
But hey i need to start somewhere so, here we are with this mess of a code...
It almost contain all bad coding practice...
I can't wait to be able to play so i will start to rush things even more.
I WANNA PLAY MAGIC!
